# Sourcemapper

Sourcemapper is a bit of golang to parse a sourcemap, as generated by webpack or similar, and spit out the original JavaScript files, recreating the source tree based on the file paths in the sourcemap.

An article explaining its purpose is available here: [https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/articles/javascript-from-sourcemaps](https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/articles/javascript-from-sourcemaps)

## Install

If you have a recent version of Go installed:

```
go install github.com/denandz/sourcemapper@latest
```

Otherwise you can clone and build:

```
git clone https://github.com/denandz/sourcemapper
cd sourcemapper
go get
go build
```

## Usage

```None
./sourcemapper --help

A golang tool to parse a sourcemap as generated by webpack
or the like and spit out the original JavaScript files,
recreating the source tree based on the file paths in the sourcemap.

Usage:
  sourcemapper <URL or path> [flags]

Flags:
  -H, --header stringArray   Send headers with the request, similar to curl's -H. Can be set multiple times. For example:
                             ./sourcemapper --header "Cookie: session=bar" --header "Authorization: blerp"
                             
  -h, --help                 help for sourcemapper
  -k, --insecure             Ignore invalid TLS certificates
  -o, --output string        Source file output directory
```

Sourcemapper will download or read the map file at `url`, and then spit the sources out into the directory defined by `output`.

## Limitations

Paths such as `webpack:/~/src/whatever/omg.js` are pretty common, so this tool cleans them up on windows.
