# Sourcemapper

Sourcemapper is a bit of golang to parse a sourcemap, as generated by webpack or similar, and spit out the original JavaScript files, recreating the source tree based on the file paths in the sourcemap.

An article explaining its purpose is available here: [https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/articles/javascript-from-sourcemaps](https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/articles/javascript-from-sourcemaps)

## Usage

```None
:~$ ./sourcemapper
Usage of ./sourcemapper:
  -header value
    	A header to send with the request, similar to curl's -H. Can be set multiple times, EG: "./sourcemapper --header "Cookie: session=bar" --header "Authorization: blerp"
  -help
    	Show help
  -insecure
    	Ignore invalid TLS certificates
  -output string
    	Source file output directory - REQUIRED
  -proxy string
    	Proxy URL
  -url string
    	URL or path to the Sourcemap file - REQUIRED
```

Sourcemapper will download or read the map file at `url`, and then spit the sources out into the directory defined by `output`.

## Limitations

Paths such as `webpack:/~/src/whatever/omg.js` are pretty common, so this tool cleans them up on windows.
